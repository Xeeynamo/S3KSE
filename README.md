# Sonic 3 & Knuckles Save Editor

![Save Editor logo](logo.png)

This is a project I decided to not longer maintain the 25 September of 2010.

Since a fan asked for a re-upload of this as my old website went down, I decided not only to re-upload it, but to make it open source and fix some annoying stuff that affected the 9 years old release!

The quality of the code is terrible (I was a teenager with few months of programming knowledge) and there are minor English grammar errors across comments or variable names.
